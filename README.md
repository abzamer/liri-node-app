# LIRI-node-app
LIRI is a node app that allows users to search for a song, movie, or concert. LIRI uses different APIs to retrieve data and output to the user. 


## Technology Used
* Node-Spotify-API
* Axios, which is used to get data from the following:
* OMDB API
* Bands In Town API
* Moment
* DotEnv


## Launch
In order to use LIRI, you must have the technologies mentioned above. Once installed, LIRI can be accessed by going to liri.js and inputing one of the following commands:
* node liri.js spotify-this-song <song name>
* node liri.js movie-this <movie title>
* node liri.js concert-this <artist name>
  
If you choose to simply enter the command without your choice of song or movie, LIRI will happily display its choice.
